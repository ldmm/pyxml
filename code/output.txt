7	line7	In recent years, the world witnessed some truly amazing
8	line8	events--the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of
9	line9	East and West Germany, the beginnings of democratic governments
10	line10	across Eastern Europe, and the easing of political tensions
11	line11	between the United States and the Soviet Union.  As a result,
12	line12	the current perception of most Americans is that foreign
13	line13	intelligence activity directed against the United States and the
14	line14	West is decreasing, and therefore, the need for an active,
15	line15	aggressive counterintelligence response has abated.
16	line16	Unfortunately, this is far from true.
17	line17	There can be no doubt that important changes are taking
18	line18	place in the world today.  However, improved diplomatic
19	line19	relations do not necessarily decrease the foreign intelligence
20	line20	threat to U.S. national security.  The truth remains: That
21	line21	threat still exists, as it did in the past and as it will in the
22	line22	future.
23	line23	DECADE OF THE 1980S
24	line24	The last decade of the cold war, the 1980s, was designated
25	line25	by the media as "The Decade of the Spy."  It was a time when
26	line26	Americans knew who their enemies were--a time when President
27	line27	Ronald Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as "The Evil Empire."
28	line28	The American public showed strong support of counterintelligence
29	line29	efforts and participated in the process by reporting suspicious
30	line30	events.
31	line31	During the 1980s, more than 45 people were arrested for
32	line32	espionage.  Increased human and technical resources, enhanced
33	line33	analytical and training programs, and improved coordination
34	line34	within the U.S. intelligence community and with friendly foreign
35	line35	intelligence services contributed significantly to these
36	line36	arrests.  However, much of the success in counterintelligence
37	line37	efforts came as a result of a heightened public awareness of the
38	line38	full damage caused by espionage, as well as the public's support
39	line39	of the measures designed to protect Americas vital information.
40	line40	In addition to the importance of public awareness, the
41	line41	1980s taught us several other important lessons.  First, the
42	line42	American public received a rude awakening regarding the
43	line43	vulnerability of the U.S. national security community from spies
44	line44	within its own ranks.  For example, both John Walker and Jerry
45	line45	Whitworth served in the U.S. Navy; Karel Koecher, Larry Chin,
46	line46	and Edward Howard all worked for the Central Intelligence Agency
47	line47	(CIA); Ronald Pelton was a National Security Agency employee;
48	line48	Richard Miller was an FBI Special Agent.
49	line49	Second, many of the dangers were posed by volunteers.  That
50	line50	is, many of those arrested during the 1980s, including Walker,
51	line51	simply offered to spy on their country.  And they offered to spy
52	line52	not because they had ideological differences with the U.S.
53	line53	Government or ideological sympathy with a foreign government, as
54	line54	was the case during World War II and the first decade of the
55	line55	Cold War.  They spied for the basest of reasons--money.
56	line56	Third, prosecuting spies was found to be an effective tool
57	line57	to determine the extent of the damage caused to national
58	line58	security.  Unfortunately, some of the espionage cases of the
59	line59	1980s resulted in grave damage to U.S. national security
60	line60	interests.  But, without the prosecutions that followed, an
61	line61	accurate accounting of what was lost would not have been
62	line62	possible, and appropriate steps to minimize the damage would not
63	line63	have been taken.  Fortunately, in 45 percent of the espionage
64	line64	cases during the 1980s, the work the U.S. counterintelligence
65	line65	community uncovered either prevented the espionage activity or
66	line66	significantly limited the  damages.
67	line67	THE CHANGING WORLD
68	line68	In the 1990s, with the easing of tensions between
69	line69	superpowers and military blocs, it is no longer possible to
70	line70	identify the U.S. counterintelligence mission in terms of these
71	line71	relationships alone--the world has become much too complex for
72	line72	that.  America has negotiated historic arms reduction treaties
73	line73	with the Soviets.  The Soviets have introduced their programs of
74	line74	Glasnost, openness to the West, and Perestroika, internal
75	line75	economic and political restructuring.  And, the world has
76	line76	witnessed the nations of Eastern Europe revolt against their
77	line77	former Communist leaders in favor of new freedom and economic
78	line78	diversity, and in some  cases, more democratic forms of
79	line79	government.
80	line80	While all Americans can agree that the world has changed,
81	line81	and most see that change as positive in terms of an enhanced
82	line82	prospect for world peace, the public tends to view this new
83	line83	world order to be devoid of danger.  So, the logic goes, that if
84	line84	there is no longer a threat to U.S. national security, then
85	line85	counterintelligence measures are not needed.
86	line86	But, the reality is that arms reduction treaties between
87	line87	the United States and the Soviet Union give Soviet "inspectors"
88	line88	potential access to some of this country's most sensitive
89	line89	projects.  Glasnost has dramatically expanded the number of
90	line90	exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union in such
91	line91	areas as business, science, and education.  In fact, since
92	line92	Glasnost, the number of Soviets traveling to the United States
93	line93	increased almost 400 percent; in 1990 alone, more than 100,000
94	line94	Soviets visited the United States.  Past experience shows that
95	line95	these exchange groups often contain intelligence officers.
96	line96	Furthermore, the countries of Eastern Europe, while attempting
97	line97	to move away from the Soviet sphere of influence, are now
98	line98	fighting for their own economic survival--and they, too, have a
99	line99	need for Western technology.
100	line100	CURRENT INTELLIGENCE THREATS
101	line101	Arms control treaties between the Soviet Union and the
102	line102	United States will hopefully lead to a diminished threat level
103	line103	between the nations.  However, from a counterintelligence
104	line104	perspective, these treaties will give the Soviet intelligence
105	line105	services routine access to sensitive areas and to knowledgeable
106	line106	Americans who are linked to classified information which, until
107	line107	now, was attainable only on a very limited basis.  Other
108	line108	treaties presently being negotiated, concerning strategic arms
109	line109	reduction and chemical weapons, would require numerous
110	line110	verification sites, again expanding Soviet access.
111	line111	But, the Soviets are interested in more than American
112	line112	military secrets.  The Soviet economy is in desperate shape and
113	line113	can be revitalized with Western technology, capital, and
114	line114	expertise.  In order to strengthen that economy, the chairman of
115	line115	the KGB has publicly stated that it plans to assist Soviet
116	line116	businesses because, as he says, "They are not good businessmen."
117	line117	The Soviets have systematically expanded their intelligence
118	line118	collection beyond military intelligence targets and now
119	line119	routinely include Western economic information and technologies.
120	line120	Since the Soviets can no longer rely on their former
121	line121	surrogate intelligence services in the Eastern Bloc to collect
122	line122	intelligence for them, they must find other sources of
123	line123	intelligence and develop new surrogate services.  The Soviets
124	line124	have started using the intelligence services of other countries
125	line125	to obtain Stealth technology and acquire restricted computer
126	line126	technologies for themselves.
127	line127	Recent repression by the Soviet government of dissent in
128	line128	the Baltic Republics may very well signal a new shift in Soviet
129	line129	internal policy away from the liberalization of Glasnost.  This,
130	line130	in turn, may have far-reaching implications involving the Soviet
131	line131	military and its intelligence services, U.S. national security,
132	line132	and the emerging "new world order."
133	line133	All in all, while the nature of the Soviet intelligence
134	line134	threat may be changing, its objectives and actions are not.  The
135	line135	Soviet intelligence services are more active now than they have
136	line136	been at any time in the past 10 years, and there is every reason
137	line137	to believe that they will continue their pursuit of Western
138	line138	intelligence during the 1990s.
139	line139	The threat of Eastern European countries to the United
140	line140	States cannot be fully assessed because they themselves have not
141	line141	yet fully defined the nature and scope of their intelligence
142	line142	services.  Some of these countries are no longer collecting
143	line143	intelligence on behalf of the Soviet Union; however, they will,
144	line144	in all likelihood, refocus their collection activities in the
145	line145	United States to fulfill their own requirements.  Since, as with
146	line146	the Soviets, the current major focus of these nations is
147	line147	economic reorganization and growth, they also have a real need
148	line148	for Western technology.
149	line149	What about the People's Republic of China (PRC)?  The PRC
150	line150	has the largest foreign official presence in the United
151	line151	States--2,700 diplomats and commercial officials, 43,000
152	line152	scholars, 25,000 commercial delegates visiting the United States
153	line153	annually, and 20,000 emigres coming to America each year.  The
154	line154	PRC remains a major counterintelligence threat to the United
155	line155	States.  Their intelligence services target well-educated
156	line156	Chinese-American scientists and other professionals who have
157	line157	access to useful information and technology using the approach:
158	line158	"Please help China modernize."
159	line159	While the Soviet Union, the former Eastern Bloc countries,
160	line160	and the People's Republic of China are all traditional
161	line161	intelligence threats, U.S. counterintelligence efforts can no
162	line162	longer focus exclusively on these countries.  In this
163	line163	information age, any number of countries can attempt to
164	line164	establish the infrastructure required to carry out intelligence
165	line165	collection activities in the United States, both overtly and
166	line166	clandestinely.  Essentially, Americans need to be concerned
167	line167	about nontraditional intelligence threats to this country as
168	line168	well.
169	line169	With this point in mind, the intelligence activities of
170	line170	countries in the Middle East and Central Asia are becoming more
171	line171	significant.  For example, the Iraqi intelligence service was
172	line172	very active in the United States during the 1980s, and in light
173	line173	of the recent war in the Persian Gulf, its activities are likely
174	line174	to continue.
175	line175	COUNTERINTELLIGENCE RESPONSIBILITIES
176	line176	The FBI is charged with countering the hostile activities
177	line177	of foreign intelligence services in the United States by
178	line178	identifying and neutralizing these activities.  It does this by
179	line179	penetrating these services, disrupting or publicizing their
180	line180	illegal activities, and expelling, arresting, or prosecuting
181	line181	those responsible.
182	line182	However, the FBI cannot meet its counterintelligence
183	line183	mission alone.  Coordination of counterintelligence operations
184	line184	with other members of the intelligence community, and frequently
185	line185	joint operations, is critical to the Bureau's success, along
186	line186	with the support of the Executive and Legislative Branches of
187	line187	the Federal Government, the law enforcement community, and the
188	line188	American public.
189	line189	While the FBI has the responsibility to make the public
190	line190	more aware of the hostile intelligence threat, it relies heavily
191	line191	on information from the public to fulfill its
192	line192	counterintelligence mission.  Because many Americans no longer
193	line193	perceive the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries
194	line194	as a threat to U.S. security, the FBI must comprehensively
195	line195	expose the full scope of this threat to American institutions,
196	line196	facilities, and citizens.  The purpose behind this is to protect
197	line197	national security, not to discourage improved relations and
198	line198	trade between the United States and the rest of the world.
199	line199	CONCLUSION
200	line200	The world is in a constant state of flux.  What is true
201	line201	today may not be true tomorrow.  For this reason, it is
202	line202	critical to identify the exact nature of any hostile
203	line203	intelligence threat to national security and to counter that
204	line204	threat.
205	line205	A heightened awareness by all Americans is the most
206	line206	effective weapon available to accomplish this task.  By working
207	line207	together, citizens and law enforcement agencies can successfully
208	line208	meet the counterintelligence challenges of today and those of
209	line209	the years to come.
