    <l n="130">Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds</l>
    <l n="131">Fearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;</l>
    <l n="132">And put to proof his high Supremacy,</l>
    <l n="133">Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,</l>
    <l n="134">Too well I see and rue the dire event,</l>
    <l n="135">That with sad overthrow and foul defeat</l>
    <l n="136">Hath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host</l>
    <l n="137">In horrible destruction laid thus low,</l>
    <l n="138">As far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences</l>
    <l n="139">Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains</l>
    <l n="140">Invincible, and vigour soon returns,</l>
    <l n="141">Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state</l>
    <l n="142">Here swallow’d up in endless misery.</l>
    <l n="143">But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now</l>

    <l n="145">Then such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)</l>
    <l n="146">Have left us this our spirit and strength intire</l>

    <l n="148">That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,</l>
    <l n="149">Or do him mightier service as his thralls</l>
    <l n="150">By right of Warr, what e’re his business be</l>
    <l n="151">Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,</l>
    <l n="152">Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;</l>
    <l n="153">What can it then avail though yet we feel</l>
    <l n="154">Strength undiminisht, or eternal being</l>

    <l n="158">Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,</l>
    <l n="159">To do ought good never will be our task,</l>
    <l n="160">But ever to do ill our sole delight,</l>
    <l n="161">As being the contrary to his high will</l>
    <l n="162">Whom we resist.  If then his Providence</l>
    <l n="163">Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,</l>
    <l n="164">Our labour must be to pervert that end,</l>
    <l n="165">And out of good still to find means of evil;</l>
    <l n="166">Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps</l>
    <l n="167">Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb</l>
    <l n="168">His inmost counsels from their destind aim.</l>
    <l n="169">But see the angry Victor hath recall’d</l>
    <l n="170">His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit</l>
    <l n="171">Back to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail</l>
    <l n="172">Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid</l>
    <l n="173">The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice</l>
    <l n="174">Of Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,</l>
    <l n="175">Wing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,</l>
    <l n="176">Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</l>
    <l n="177">To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.</l>
    <l n="178">Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,</l>
    <l n="179">Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.</l>
    <l n="180">Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,</l>

    <l n="182">Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</l>
    <l n="183">Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend</l>
    <l n="184">From off the tossing of these fiery waves,</l>
    <l n="185">There rest, if any rest can harbour there,</l>
    <l n="186">And reassembling our afflicted Powers,</l>
    <l n="187">Consult how we may henceforth most offend</l>
    <l n="188">Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,</l>

  </lg>
  <lg n="7">
    <l n="192">Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate</l>
    <l n="193">With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes</l>

    <l n="212">And high permission of all-ruling Heaven</l>
    <l n="213">Left him at large to his own dark designs,</l>
    <l n="214">That with reiterated crimes he might</l>
    <l n="215">Heap on himself damnation, while he sought</l>
    <l n="216">Evil to others, and enrag’d might see</l>
    <l n="217">How all his malice serv’d but to bring forth</l>
    <l n="218">Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn</l>
    <l n="219">On Man by him seduc’t, but on himself</l>
    <l n="220">Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.</l>
    <l n="221">Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool</l>

    <l n="227">That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land</l>
    <l n="228">He lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d</l>
    <l n="229">With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;</l>
    <l n="230">And such appear’d in hue, as when the force</l>

    <l n="427">Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,</l>
    <l n="428">Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose</l>
    <l n="429">Dilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,</l>
    <l n="430">Can execute their aerie purposes,</l>

    <l n="432">For those the Race of <hi>Israel</hi> oft forsook</l>
    <l n="433">Their living strength, and unfrequented left</l>
    <l n="434">His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down</l>
    <l n="435">To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low</l>
    <l n="436">Bow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear</l>
    <l n="437">Of despicable foes.  With these in troop</l>
    <l n="438">Came <hi>Astoreth</hi>, whom the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> call’d</l>
    <l n="439"><hi>Astarte</hi>, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;</l>
    <l n="440">To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon</l>
    <l n="441"><hi>Sidonian</hi> Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,</l>
    <l n="442">In <hi>Sion</hi> also not unsung, where stood</l>
    <l n="443">Her Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built</l>
    <l n="444">By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,</l>
    <l n="445">Beguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell</l>
    <l n="446">To Idols foul. <hi>Thammuz</hi> came next behind,</l>
    <l n="447">Whose annual wound in <hi>Lebanon</hi> allur’d</l>
    <l n="448">The <hi>Syrian</hi> Damsels to lament his fate</l>
    <l n="449">In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,</l>
    <l n="450">While smooth <hi>Adonis</hi> from his native Rock</l>
    <l n="451">Ran purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood</l>
    <l n="452">Of <hi>Thammuz</hi> yearly wounded: the Love-tale</l>
    <l n="453">Infected <hi>Sions</hi> daughters with like heat,</l>
    <l n="454">Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch</l>
    <l n="455"><hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw, when by the Vision led</l>
    <l n="456">His eye survay’d the dark Idolatries</l>
    <l n="457">Of alienated <hi>Judah</hi>.  Next came one</l>
    <l n="458">Who mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark</l>
    <l n="459">Maim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off</l>
    <l n="460">In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,</l>
    <l n="461">Where he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:</l>
    <l n="462"><hi>Dagon</hi> his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man</l>
    <l n="463">And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high</l>
    <l n="464">Rear’d in <hi>Azotus</hi>, dreaded through the Coast</l>
    <l n="465">Of <hi>Palestine</hi>, in <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Ascalon</hi>,</l>
    <l n="466">And <hi>Accaron</hi> and <hi>Gaza’s</hi> frontier bounds.</l>
    <l n="467">Him follow’d <hi>Rimmon</hi>, whose delightful Seat</l>
    <l n="468">Was fair <hi>Damscus</hi>, on the fertil Banks</l>
    <l n="469">Of <hi>Abbana</hi> and <hi>Pharphar</hi>, lucid streams.</l>
    <l n="470">He also against the house of God was bold:</l>
    <l n="471">A Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,</l>
    <l n="472"><hi>Ahaz</hi> his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew</l>
    <l n="473">Gods Altar to disparage and displace</l>
    <l n="474">For one of <hi>Syrian</hi> mode, whereon to burn</l>
    <l n="475">His odious offrings, and adore the Gods</l>
    <l n="476">Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d</l>
    <l n="477">A crew who under Names of old Renown,</l>
    <l n="478"><hi>Osiris</hi>, <hi>Isis</hi>, <hi>Orus</hi> and their Train</l>
    <l n="479">With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d</l>
    <l n="480">Fanatic <hi>Egypt</hi> and her Priests, to seek</l>
    <l n="481">Thir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms</l>
    <l n="482">Rather then human.  Nor did <hi>Israel</hi> scape</l>
    <l n="483">Th’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d</l>
    <l n="484">The Calf in <hi>Oreb</hi>: and the Rebel King</l>
    <l n="485">Doubl’d that sin in <hi>Bethel</hi> and in <hi>Dan</hi>,</l>
    <l n="486">Lik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,</l>
    <l n="487"><hi>Jehovah</hi>, who in one Night when he pass’d</l>
    <l n="488">From <hi>Egypt</hi> marching, equal’d with one stroke</l>
    <l n="489">Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.</l>
    <l n="490"><hi>Belial</hi> came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd</l>
    <l n="491">Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love</l>
    <l n="492">Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood</l>
    <l n="493">Or Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee</l>
    <l n="494">In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest</l>
    <l n="495">Turns Atheist, as did <hi>Ely’s</hi> Sons, who fill’d</l>
    <l n="496">With lust and violence the house of God.</l>
    <l n="497">In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns</l>
    <l n="498">And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse</l>
    <l n="499">Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,</l>
    <l n="500">And injury and outrage: And when Night</l>
    <l n="501">Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons</l>
    <l n="502">Of <hi>Belial</hi>, flown with insolence and wine.</l>
    <l n="503">Witness the Streets of <hi>Sodom</hi>, and that night</l>
    <l n="504">In <hi>Gibeah</hi>, when hospitable Dores</l>

    <l n="506">These were the prime in order and in might;</l>

    <l n="521">And ore the <hi>Celtic</hi> roam’d the utmost Isles.</l>
    <l n="522">All these and more came flocking; but with looks</l>
    <l n="523">Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d</l>
    <l n="524">Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief</l>

    <l n="527">Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride</l>
    <l n="528">Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore</l>
    <l n="529">Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d</l>
    <l n="530">Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.</l>
    <l n="531">Then strait commands that at the warlike sound</l>
    <l n="532">Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard</l>
    <l n="533">His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d</l>
    <l n="534"><hi>Azazel</hi> as his right, a Cherube tall:</l>

    <l n="544">All in a moment through the gloom were seen</l>
    <l n="545">Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air</l>

    <l n="549">Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move</l>
    <l n="550">In perfect <hi>Phalanx</hi> to the Dorian mood</l>

    <l n="592">All her Original brightness, nor appear’d</l>
    <l n="593">Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess</l>
    <l n="594">Of Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n</l>
    <l n="595">Looks through the Horizontal misty Air</l>
    <l n="596">Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon</l>
    <l n="597">In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds</l>
    <l n="598">On half the Nations, and with fear of change</l>
    <l n="599">Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon</l>
    <l n="600">Above them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face</l>
    <l n="601">Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care</l>
    <l n="602">Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes</l>
    <l n="603">Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride</l>
    <l n="604">Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast</l>
    <l n="605">Signs of remorse and passion to behold</l>
    <l n="606">The fellows of his crime, the followers rather</l>
    <l n="607">(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d</l>
    <l n="608">For ever now to have their lot in pain,</l>
    <l n="609">Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t</l>
    <l n="610">Of Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung</l>
    <l n="611">For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,</l>
    <l n="612">Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire</l>
    <l n="613">Hath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,</l>
    <l n="614">With singed top their stately growth though bare</l>
    <l n="615">Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d</l>
    <l n="616">To speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend</l>
    <l n="617">From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round</l>
    <l n="618">With all his Peers: attention held them mute.</l>
    <l n="619">Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,</l>
    <l n="620">Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last</l>
    <l n="621">Words interwove with sighs found out their way.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg n="12">
    <l n="622">O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers</l>
    <l n="623">Matchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife</l>
    <l n="624">Was not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,</l>
    <l n="625">As this place testifies, and this dire change</l>
    <l n="626">Hateful to utter: but what power of mind</l>
    <l n="627">Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth</l>
    <l n="628">Of knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,</l>
    <l n="629">How such united force of Gods, how such</l>
    <l n="630">As stood like these, could ever know repulse?</l>
    <l n="631">For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,</l>
    <l n="632">That all these puissant Legions, whose exile</l>
    <l n="633">Hath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend</l>
    <l n="634">Self-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.</l>
    <l n="635">For me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,</l>
    <l n="636">If counsels different, or danger shun’d</l>
    <l n="637">By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns</l>
    <l n="638">Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure</l>
    <l n="639">Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,</l>
    <l n="640">Consent or custome, and his Regal State</l>
    <l n="641">Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,</l>
    <l n="642">Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.</l>
    <l n="643">Henceforth his might we know, and know our own</l>
    <l n="644">So as not either to provoke, or dread</l>
    <l n="645">New warr, provok’t; our better part remains</l>
    <l n="646">To work in close design, by fraud or guile</l>
    <l n="647">What force effected not: that he no less</l>
    <l n="648">At length from us may find, who overcomes</l>
    <l n="649">By force, hath overcome but half his foe.</l>
    <l n="650">Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife</l>
    <l n="651">There went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long</l>
    <l n="652">Intended to create, and therein plant</l>
    <l n="653">A generation, whom his choice regard</l>
    <l n="654">Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:</l>
    <l n="655">Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps</l>
    <l n="656">Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:</l>
    <l n="657">For this Infernal Pit shall never hold</l>
    <l n="658">Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse</l>
    <l n="659">Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts</l>
    <l n="660">Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,</l>
    <l n="661">For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr</l>
    <l n="662">Open or understood must be resolv’d.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg n="13">
    <l n="663">He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew</l>
    <l n="664">Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs</l>
    <l n="665">Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze</l>
    <l n="666">Far round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d</l>
    <l n="667">Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s</l>
    <l n="668">Clash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,</l>
    <l n="669">Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg n="14">
    <l n="670">There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top</l>
    <l n="671">Belch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire</l>
    <l n="672">Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign</l>
    <l n="673">That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,</l>
    <l n="674">The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed</l>
    <l n="675">A numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands</l>
    <l n="676">Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d</l>
    <l n="677">Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,</l>
    <l n="678">Or cast a Rampart.  <hi>Mammon</hi> led them on,</l>
    <l n="679"><hi>Mammon</hi>, the least erected Spirit that fell</l>
    <l n="680">From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks &amp; thoughts</l>
    <l n="681">Were always downward bent, admiring more</l>
    <l n="682">The riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,</l>
    <l n="683">Then aught divine or holy else enjoy’d</l>
    <l n="684">In vision beatific: by him first</l>
    <l n="685">Men also, and by his suggestion taught,</l>
    <l n="686">Ransack’d the Center, and with impious hands</l>
    <l n="687">Rifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth</l>
    <l n="688">For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew</l>
    <l n="689">Op’nd into the Hill a spacious wound</l>
    <l n="690">And dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire</l>
    <l n="691">That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best</l>
    <l n="692">Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those</l>
    <l n="693">Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell</l>
    <l n="694">Of <hi>Babel</hi>, and the works of <hi>Memphian</hi> Kings,</l>
    <l n="695">Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,</l>
    <l n="696">And Strength and Art are easily outdone</l>
    <l n="697">By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour</l>
    <l n="698">What in an age they with incessant toyle</l>
    <l n="699">And hands innumerable scarce perform</l>
    <l n="700">Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,</l>
    <l n="701">That underneath had veins of liquid fire</l>
    <l n="702">Sluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude</l>
    <l n="703">With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,</l>
    <l n="704">Severing each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:</l>
    <l n="705">A third as soon had form’d within the ground</l>
    <l n="706">A various mould, and from the boyling cells</l>
    <l n="707">By strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,</l>
    <l n="708">As in an Organ from one blast of wind</l>
    <l n="709">To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.</l>
    <l n="710">Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge</l>
    <l n="711">Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound</l>
    <l n="712">Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,</l>
    <l n="713">Built like a Temple, where <hi>Pilasters</hi> round</l>
    <l n="714">Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid</l>
    <l n="715">With Golden Architrave; nor did there want</l>
    <l n="716">Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,</l>

    <l n="731">Admiring enter’d, and the work some praise</l>
    <l n="732">And some the Architect: his hand was known</l>
    <l n="733">In Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,</l>
    <l n="734">Where Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,</l>
    <l n="735">And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King</l>
    <l n="736">Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,</l>
    <l n="737">Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.</l>
    <l n="738">Nor was his name unheard or unador’d</l>
    <l n="739">In ancient Greece; and in <hi>Ausonian</hi> land</l>
    <l n="740">Men call’d him <hi>Mulciber</hi>; and how he fell</l>

    <l n="742">Sheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn</l>
    <l n="743">To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,</l>
    <l n="744">A Summers day; and with the setting Sun</l>
    <l n="745">Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,</l>
    <l n="746">On <hi>Lemnos</hi> th’ <hi>Aegaean</hi> Ile: thus they relate,</l>
    <l n="747">Erring; for he with this rebellious rout</l>
    <l n="748">Fell long before; nor aught avail’d him now</l>
    <l n="749">To have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape</l>
    <l n="750">By all his Engins, but was headlong sent</l>
    <l n="751">With his industrious crew to build in hell.</l>
    <l n="752">Mean while the winged Haralds by command</l>
    <l n="753">Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony</l>

    <l n="762">And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall</l>
    <l n="763">(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold</l>
    <l n="764">Wont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair</l>
    <l n="765">Defi’d the best of Panim chivalry</l>
    <l n="766">To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)</l>
    <l n="767">Thick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,</l>

    <l n="788">At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.</l>
    <l n="789">Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms</l>

    <l n="795">In close recess and secret conclave sat</l>
    <l n="796">A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,</l>
