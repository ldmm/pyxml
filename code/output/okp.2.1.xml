  <line n="0">Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit</line>
  <line n="1">Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast</line>
  <line n="2">Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,</line>
  <line n="3">With loss of _Eden_, till one greater Man</line>
  <line n="4">Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,</line>
  <line n="5">Sing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret top</line>
  <line n="6">Of _Oreb_, or of _Sinai_, didst inspire</line>
  <line n="7">That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,</line>
  <line n="8">In the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth</line>
  <line n="9">Rose out of _Chaos_: Or if _Sion_ Hill</line>
  <line n="10">Delight thee more, and _Siloa’s_ Brook that flow’d</line>

  <line n="19">Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread</line>
  <line n="20">Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss</line>
  <line n="21">And mad’st it pregnant: What in me is dark</line>

  <line n="23">That to the highth of this great Argument</line>
  <line n="24">I may assert th’ Eternal Providence,</line>

  <line n="27">Say first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view</line>
  <line n="28">Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause</line>
  <line n="29">Mov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State,</line>
  <line n="30">Favour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off</line>
  <line n="31">From their Creator, and transgress his Will</line>
  <line n="32">For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?</line>
  <line n="33">Who first seduc’d them to that fowl revolt?</line>
  <line n="34">Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile</line>
  <line n="35">Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d</line>
  <line n="36">The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride</line>
  <line n="37">Had cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host</line>
  <line n="38">Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring</line>
  <line n="39">To set himself in Glory above his Peers,</line>
  <line n="40">He trusted to have equal’d the most High,</line>
  <line n="41">If he oppos’d; and with ambitious aim</line>
  <line n="42">Against the Throne and Monarchy of God</line>
  <line n="43">Rais’d impious War in Heav’n and Battel proud</line>
  <line n="44">With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power</line>
  <line n="45">Hurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie</line>
  <line n="46">With hideous ruine and combustion down</line>
  <line n="47">To bottomless perdition, there to dwell</line>
  <line n="48">In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,</line>
  <line n="49">Who durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms.</line>
  <line n="50">Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night</line>
  <line n="51">To mortal men, he with his horrid crew</line>
  <line n="52">Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe</line>
  <line n="53">Confounded though immortal: But his doom</line>
  <line n="54">Reserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought</line>
  <line n="55">Both of lost happiness and lasting pain</line>
  <line n="56">Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes</line>
  <line n="57">That witness’d huge affliction and dismay</line>
  <line n="58">Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:</line>
  <line n="59">At once as far as Angels kenn he views</line>
  <line n="60">The dismal Situation waste and wilde,</line>
  <line n="61">A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round</line>
  <line n="62">As one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames</line>
  <line n="63">No light, but rather darkness visible</line>
  <line n="64">Serv’d only to discover sights of woe,</line>
  <line n="65">Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace</line>
  <line n="66">And rest can never dwell, hope never comes</line>
  <line n="67">That comes to all; but torture without end</line>
  <line n="68">Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed</line>
  <line n="69">With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:</line>
  <line n="70">Such place Eternal Justice had prepar’d</line>
  <line n="71">For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d</line>
  <line n="72">In utter darkness, and their portion set</line>
  <line n="73">As far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n</line>
  <line n="74">As from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.</line>
  <line n="75">O how unlike the place from whence they fell!</line>
  <line n="76">There the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d</line>
  <line n="77">With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,</line>
  <line n="78">He soon discerns, and weltring by his side</line>
  <line n="79">One next himself in power, and next in crime,</line>
  <line n="80">Long after known in _Palestine_, and nam’d</line>
  <line n="81">_Beelzebub_.  To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,</line>
  <line n="82">And thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words</line>
  <line n="83">Breaking the horrid silence thus began.</line>
  <line n="84"></line>
  <line n="85">If thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d</line>
  <line n="86">From him, who in the happy Realms of Light</line>
  <line n="87">Cloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine</line>
  <line n="88">Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,</line>
  <line n="89">United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,</line>
  <line n="90">And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,</line>
  <line n="91">Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd</line>
  <line n="92">In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest</line>
  <line n="93">From what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd</line>
  <line n="94">He with his Thunder: and till then who knew</line>
  <line n="95">The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those</line>
  <line n="96">Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage</line>
  <line n="97">Can else inflict do I repent or change,</line>
  <line n="98">Though chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind</line>
  <line n="99">And high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit,</line>
  <line n="100">That with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,</line>
  <line n="101">And to the fierce contention brought along</line>
  <line n="102">Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d</line>
  <line n="103">That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,</line>
  <line n="104">His utmost power with adverse power oppos’d</line>
  <line n="105">In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,</line>
  <line n="106">And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?</line>
  <line n="107">All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,</line>
  <line n="108">And study of revenge, immortal hate,</line>
  <line n="109">And courage never to submit or yield:</line>
  <line n="110">And what is else not to be overcome?</line>
  <line n="111">That Glory never shall his wrath or might</line>
  <line n="112">Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace</line>
  <line n="113">With suppliant knee, and deifie his power</line>
  <line n="114">Who from the terrour of this Arm so late</line>
  <line n="115">Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,</line>
  <line n="116">That were an ignominy and shame beneath</line>
  <line n="117">This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods</line>
  <line n="118">And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,</line>
  <line n="119">Since through experience of this great event</line>
  <line n="120">In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,</line>
  <line n="121">We may with more successful hope resolve</line>
  <line n="122">To wage by force or guile eternal Warr</line>
  <line n="123">Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,</line>
  <line n="124">Who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy</line>
  <line n="125">Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.</line>
  <line n="126"></line>
  <line n="127">So spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,</line>
  <line n="128">Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:</line>
  <line n="129">And him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.</line>
  <line n="130"></line>
  <line n="131">O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,</line>
  <line n="132">That led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr</line>
  <line n="133">Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds</line>
  <line n="134">Fearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;</line>
  <line n="135">And put to proof his high Supremacy,</line>
  <line n="136">Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,</line>
  <line n="137">Too well I see and rue the dire event,</line>
  <line n="138">That with sad overthrow and foul defeat</line>
  <line n="139">Hath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host</line>
  <line n="140">In horrible destruction laid thus low,</line>
  <line n="141">As far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences</line>
  <line n="142">Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains</line>
  <line n="143">Invincible, and vigour soon returns,</line>
  <line n="144">Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state</line>
  <line n="145">Here swallow’d up in endless misery.</line>
  <line n="146">But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now</line>
  <line n="147">Of force believe Almighty, since no less</line>
  <line n="148">Then such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)</line>
  <line n="149">Have left us this our spirit and strength intire</line>
  <line n="150">Strongly to suffer and support our pains,</line>
  <line n="151">That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,</line>
  <line n="152">Or do him mightier service as his thralls</line>
  <line n="153">By right of Warr, what e’re his business be</line>
  <line n="154">Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,</line>
  <line n="155">Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;</line>
  <line n="156">What can it then avail though yet we feel</line>
  <line n="157">Strength undiminisht, or eternal being</line>
  <line n="158">To undergo eternal punishment?</line>
  <line n="159">Whereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.</line>
  <line n="160"></line>
  <line n="161">Fall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable</line>
  <line n="162">Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,</line>
  <line n="163">To do ought good never will be our task,</line>
  <line n="164">But ever to do ill our sole delight,</line>
  <line n="165">As being the contrary to his high will</line>
  <line n="166">Whom we resist.  If then his Providence</line>
  <line n="167">Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,</line>
  <line n="168">Our labour must be to pervert that end,</line>
  <line n="169">And out of good still to find means of evil;</line>
  <line n="170">Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps</line>
  <line n="171">Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb</line>
  <line n="172">His inmost counsels from their destind aim.</line>
  <line n="173">But see the angry Victor hath recall’d</line>
  <line n="174">His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit</line>
  <line n="175">Back to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail</line>
  <line n="176">Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid</line>
  <line n="177">The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice</line>
  <line n="178">Of Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,</line>
  <line n="179">Wing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,</line>
  <line n="180">Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</line>
  <line n="181">To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.</line>
  <line n="182">Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,</line>
  <line n="183">Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.</line>
  <line n="184">Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,</line>
  <line n="185">The seat of desolation, voyd of light,</line>
  <line n="186">Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</line>
  <line n="187">Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend</line>
  <line n="188">From off the tossing of these fiery waves,</line>
  <line n="189">There rest, if any rest can harbour there,</line>
  <line n="190">And reassembling our afflicted Powers,</line>
  <line n="191">Consult how we may henceforth most offend</line>
  <line n="192">Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,</line>
  <line n="193">How overcome this dire Calamity,</line>
  <line n="194">What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,</line>
  <line n="195">If not what resolution from despare.</line>
  <line n="196"></line>
  <line n="197">Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate</line>
  <line n="198">With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes</line>
  <line n="199">That sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides</line>
  <line n="200">Prone on the Flood, extended long and large</line>
  <line n="201">Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge</line>
  <line n="202">As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,</line>
  <line n="203">_Titanian_, or _Earth-born_, that warr’d on _Jove_,</line>
  <line n="204">_Briarios_ or _Typhon_, whom the Den</line>
  <line n="205">By ancient _Tarsus_ held, or that Sea-beast</line>
  <line n="206">_Leviathan_, which God of all his works</line>
  <line n="207">Created hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:</line>
  <line n="208">Him haply slumbring on the _Norway_ foam</line>
  <line n="209">The Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,</line>
  <line n="210">Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,</line>
  <line n="211">With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind</line>
  <line n="212">Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night</line>
  <line n="213">Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:</line>
  <line n="214">So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay</line>
  <line n="215">Chain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence</line>
  <line n="216">Had ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will</line>
  <line n="217">And high permission of all-ruling Heaven</line>
  <line n="218">Left him at large to his own dark designs,</line>
  <line n="219">That with reiterated crimes he might</line>
  <line n="220">Heap on himself damnation, while he sought</line>
  <line n="221">Evil to others, and enrag’d might see</line>
  <line n="222">How all his malice serv’d but to bring forth</line>
  <line n="223">Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn</line>
  <line n="224">On Man by him seduc’t, but on himself</line>
  <line n="225">Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.</line>
  <line n="226">Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool</line>
  <line n="227">His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames</line>
  <line n="228">Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld</line>
  <line n="229">In billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.</line>
  <line n="230">Then with expanded wings he stears his flight</line>
  <line n="231">Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air</line>
  <line n="232">That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land</line>
  <line n="233">He lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d</line>
  <line n="234">With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;</line>
  <line n="235">And such appear’d in hue, as when the force</line>
  <line n="236">Of subterranean wind transports a Hill</line>
  <line n="237">Torn from _Pelorus_, or the shatter’d side</line>
  <line n="238">Of thundring _Aetna_, whose combustible</line>
  <line n="239">And fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,</line>
  <line n="240">Sublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,</line>
  <line n="241">And leave a singed bottom all involv’d</line>
  <line n="242">With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole</line>
  <line n="243">Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,</line>
  <line n="244">Both glorying to have scap’t the _Stygian_ flood</line>
  <line n="245">As Gods, and by their own recover’d strength,</line>
  <line n="246">Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.</line>
  <line n="247"></line>
  <line n="248">Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,</line>
  <line n="249">Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat</line>
  <line n="250">That we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom</line>
  <line n="251">For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee</line>
  <line n="252">Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid</line>
  <line n="253">What shall be right: fardest from him is best</line>
  <line n="254">Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream</line>
  <line n="255">Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields</line>
  <line n="256">Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail</line>
  <line n="257">Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell</line>
  <line n="258">Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings</line>
  <line n="259">A mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.</line>
  <line n="260">The mind is its own place, and in it self</line>
  <line n="261">Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.</line>
  <line n="262">What matter where, if I be still the same,</line>
  <line n="263">And what I should be, all but less then hee</line>
  <line n="264">Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least</line>
  <line n="265">We shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built</line>
  <line n="266">Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:</line>
  <line n="267">Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce</line>
  <line n="268">To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:</line>
  <line n="269">Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.</line>
  <line n="270">But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,</line>
  <line n="271">Th’ associates and copartners of our loss</line>
  <line n="272">Lye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,</line>
  <line n="273">And call them not to share with us their part</line>
  <line n="274">In this unhappy Mansion, or once more</line>
  <line n="275">With rallied Arms to try what may be yet</line>
  <line n="276">Regaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?</line>
  <line n="277"></line>
  <line n="278">So _Satan_ spake, and him _Beelzebub_</line>
  <line n="279">Thus answer’d.  Leader of those Armies bright,</line>
  <line n="280">Which but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,</line>
  <line n="281">If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge</line>
  <line n="282">Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft</line>
  <line n="283">In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge</line>
  <line n="284">Of battel when it rag’d, in all assaults</line>
  <line n="285">Their surest signal, they will soon resume</line>
  <line n="286">New courage and revive, though now they lye</line>
  <line n="287">Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,</line>
  <line n="288">As we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,</line>
  <line n="289">No wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.</line>
  <line n="290"></line>
  <line n="291">He scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend</line>
  <line n="292">Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield</line>
  <line n="293">Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,</line>
  <line n="294">Behind him cast; the broad circumference</line>
  <line n="295">Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb</line>
  <line n="296">Through Optic Glass the _Tuscan_ Artist views</line>
  <line n="297">At Ev’ning from the top of _Fesole_,</line>
  <line n="298">Or in _Valdarno_, to descry new Lands,</line>
  <line n="299">Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.</line>
  <line n="300">His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine</line>
  <line n="301">Hewn on _Norwegian_ hills, to be the Mast</line>
  <line n="302">Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,</line>
  <line n="303">He walkt with to support uneasie steps</line>
  <line n="304">Over the burning Marle, not like those steps</line>
  <line n="305">On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime</line>
  <line n="306">Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;</line>
  <line n="307">Nathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach</line>
  <line n="308">Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d</line>
  <line n="309">His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t</line>
  <line n="310">Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks</line>
  <line n="311">In _Vallombrosa_, where th’ _Etrurian_ shades</line>
  <line n="312">High overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge</line>
  <line n="313">Afloat, when with fierce Winds _Orion_ arm’d</line>
  <line n="314">Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew</line>
  <line n="315">_Busiris_ and his _Memphian_ Chivalrie,</line>
  <line n="316">VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d</line>
  <line n="317">The Sojourners of _Goshen_, who beheld</line>
  <line n="318">From the safe shore their floating Carkases</line>
  <line n="319">And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown</line>
  <line n="320">Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,</line>
  <line n="321">Under amazement of their hideous change.</line>
  <line n="322">He call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep</line>
  <line n="323">Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,</line>
  <line n="324">Warriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,</line>
  <line n="325">If such astonishment as this can sieze</line>
  <line n="326">Eternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place</line>
  <line n="327">After the toyl of Battel to repose</line>
  <line n="328">Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find</line>
  <line n="329">To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?</line>
  <line n="330">Or in this abject posture have ye sworn</line>
  <line n="331">To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds</line>
  <line n="332">Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood</line>
  <line n="333">With scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon</line>
  <line n="334">His swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern</line>
  <line n="335">Th’ advantage, and descending tread us down</line>
  <line n="336">Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts</line>
  <line n="337">Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.</line>
  <line n="338">Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.</line>
  <line n="339"></line>
  <line n="340">They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung</line>
  <line n="341">Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch</line>
  <line n="342">On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,</line>
  <line n="343">Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.</line>
  <line n="344">Nor did they not perceave the evil plight</line>
  <line n="345">In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;</line>
  <line n="346">Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd</line>
  <line n="347">Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod</line>
  <line n="348">Of _Amrams_ Son in _Egypts_ evill day</line>
  <line n="349">Wav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud</line>
  <line n="350">Of _Locusts_, warping on the Eastern Wind,</line>
  <line n="351">That ore the Realm of impious _Pharoah_ hung</line>
  <line n="352">Like Night, and darken’d all the Land of _Nile_:</line>
  <line n="353">So numberless were those bad Angels seen</line>
  <line n="354">Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell</line>
  <line n="355">’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;</line>
  <line n="356">Till, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear</line>
  <line n="357">Of their great Sultan waving to direct</line>
  <line n="358">Thir course, in even ballance down they light</line>
  <line n="359">On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;</line>
  <line n="360">A multitude, like which the populous North</line>
  <line n="361">Pour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass</line>
  <line n="362">_Rhene_ or the _Danaw_, when her barbarous Sons</line>
  <line n="363">Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread</line>
  <line n="364">Beneath _Gibraltar_ to the _Lybian_ sands.</line>
  <line n="365">Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band</line>
  <line n="366">The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood</line>
  <line n="367">Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms</line>
  <line n="368">Excelling human, Princely Dignities,</line>
  <line n="369">And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;</line>
  <line n="370">Though of their Names in heav’nly Records now</line>
  <line n="371">Be no memorial, blotted out and ras’d</line>
  <line n="372">By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.</line>
  <line n="373">Nor had they yet among the Sons of _Eve_</line>
  <line n="374">Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,</line>
  <line n="375">Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,</line>
  <line n="376">By falsities and lyes the greatest part</line>
  <line n="377">Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake</line>
  <line n="378">God their Creator, and th’ invisible</line>
  <line n="379">Glory of him, that made them, to transform</line>
  <line n="380">Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d</line>
  <line n="381">With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,</line>
  <line n="382">And Devils to adore for Deities:</line>
  <line n="383">Then were they known to men by various Names,</line>
  <line n="384">And various Idols through the Heathen World.</line>
  <line n="385">Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,</line>
  <line n="386">Rous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,</line>
  <line n="387">At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth</line>
  <line n="388">Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,</line>
  <line n="389">While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?</line>
  <line n="390">The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell</line>
  <line n="391">Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix</line>
  <line n="392">Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,</line>
  <line n="393">Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d</line>
  <line n="394">Among the Nations round, and durst abide</line>
  <line n="395">_Jehovah_ thundring out of _Sion_, thron’d</line>
  <line n="396">Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d</line>
  <line n="397">Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,</line>
  <line n="398">Abominations; and with cursed things</line>
  <line n="399">His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d,</line>
  <line n="400">And with their darkness durst affront his light.</line>
  <line n="401">First _Moloch_, horrid King besmear’d with blood</line>
  <line n="402">Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,</line>
  <line n="403">Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud</line>
  <line n="404">Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire</line>
  <line n="405">To his grim Idol.  Him the _Ammonite_</line>
  <line n="406">Worshipt in _Rabba_ and her watry Plain,</line>
  <line n="407">In _Argob_ and in _Basan_, to the stream</line>
  <line n="408">Of utmost _Arnon_.  Nor content with such</line>
  <line n="409">Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart</line>
  <line n="410">Of _Solomon_ he led by fraud to build</line>
  <line n="411">His Temple right against the Temple of God</line>
  <line n="412">On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove</line>
  <line n="413">The pleasant Vally of _Hinnom_, _Tophet_ thence</line>
  <line n="414">And black _Gehenna_ call’d, the Type of Hell.</line>
  <line n="415">Next _Chemos_, th’ obscene dread of _Moabs_ Sons,</line>
  <line n="416">From _Aroer_ to _Nebo_, and the wild</line>
  <line n="417">Of Southmost _Abarim_; in _Hesebon_</line>
  <line n="418">And _Heronaim_, _Seons_ Realm, beyond</line>

  <line n="420">And _Eleale_ to th’ _Asphaltick_ Pool.</line>
  <line n="421">_Peor_ his other Name, when he entic’d</line>
  <line n="422">_Israel_ in _Sittim_ on their march from _Nile_</line>
  <line n="423">To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.</line>
  <line n="424">Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d</line>
  <line n="425">Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove</line>
  <line n="426">Of _Moloch_ homicide, lust hard by hate;</line>
  <line n="427">Till good _Josiah_ drove them thence to Hell.</line>
  <line n="428">With these came they, who from the bordring flood</line>
  <line n="429">Of old _Euphrates_ to the Brook that parts</line>
  <line n="430">_Egypt_ from _Syrian_ ground, had general Names</line>
  <line n="431">Of _Baalim_ and _Ashtaroth_, those male,</line>
  <line n="432">These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please</line>
  <line n="433">Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft</line>
  <line n="434">And uncompounded is their Essence pure,</line>
  <line n="435">Not ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,</line>
  <line n="436">Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,</line>
  <line n="437">Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose</line>
  <line n="438">Dilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,</line>
  <line n="439">Can execute their aerie purposes,</line>
  <line n="440">And works of love or enmity fulfill.</line>
  <line n="441">For those the Race of _Israel_ oft forsook</line>
  <line n="442">Their living strength, and unfrequented left</line>
  <line n="443">His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down</line>
  <line n="444">To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low</line>
  <line n="445">Bow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear</line>
  <line n="446">Of despicable foes.  With these in troop</line>
  <line n="447">Came _Astoreth_, whom the _Phoenicians_ call’d</line>
  <line n="448">_Astarte_, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;</line>
  <line n="449">To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon</line>
  <line n="450">_Sidonian_ Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,</line>
  <line n="451">In _Sion_ also not unsung, where stood</line>
  <line n="452">Her Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built</line>
  <line n="453">By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,</line>
  <line n="454">Beguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell</line>
  <line n="455">To Idols foul. _Thammuz_ came next behind,</line>
  <line n="456">Whose annual wound in _Lebanon_ allur’d</line>
  <line n="457">The _Syrian_ Damsels to lament his fate</line>
  <line n="458">In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,</line>
  <line n="459">While smooth _Adonis_ from his native Rock</line>
  <line n="460">Ran purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood</line>
  <line n="461">Of _Thammuz_ yearly wounded: the Love-tale</line>
  <line n="462">Infected _Sions_ daughters with like heat,</line>
  <line n="463">Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch</line>
  <line n="464">_Ezekiel_ saw, when by the Vision led</line>
  <line n="465">His eye survay’d the dark Idolatries</line>
  <line n="466">Of alienated _Judah_.  Next came one</line>
  <line n="467">Who mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark</line>
  <line n="468">Maim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off</line>
  <line n="469">In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,</line>
  <line n="470">Where he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:</line>
  <line n="471">_Dagon_ his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man</line>
  <line n="472">And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high</line>
  <line n="473">Rear’d in _Azotus_, dreaded through the Coast</line>
  <line n="474">Of _Palestine_, in _Gath_ and _Ascalon_,</line>
  <line n="475">And _Accaron_ and _Gaza’s_ frontier bounds.</line>
  <line n="476">Him follow’d _Rimmon_, whose delightful Seat</line>
  <line n="477">Was fair _Damscus_, on the fertil Banks</line>
  <line n="478">Of _Abbana_ and _Pharphar_, lucid streams.</line>
  <line n="479">He also against the house of God was bold:</line>
  <line n="480">A Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,</line>
  <line n="481">_Ahaz_ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew</line>
  <line n="482">Gods Altar to disparage and displace</line>
  <line n="483">For one of _Syrian_ mode, whereon to burn</line>
  <line n="484">His odious offrings, and adore the Gods</line>
  <line n="485">Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d</line>
  <line n="486">A crew who under Names of old Renown,</line>
  <line n="487">_Osiris_, _Isis_, _Orus_ and their Train</line>
  <line n="488">With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d</line>
  <line n="489">Fanatic _Egypt_ and her Priests, to seek</line>
  <line n="490">Thir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms</line>
  <line n="491">Rather then human.  Nor did _Israel_ scape</line>
  <line n="492">Th’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d</line>
  <line n="493">The Calf in _Oreb_: and the Rebel King</line>
  <line n="494">Doubl’d that sin in _Bethel_ and in _Dan_,</line>
  <line n="495">Lik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,</line>
  <line n="496">_Jehovah_, who in one Night when he pass’d</line>
  <line n="497">From _Egypt_ marching, equal’d with one stroke</line>
  <line n="498">Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.</line>
  <line n="499">_Belial_ came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd</line>
  <line n="500">Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love</line>
  <line n="501">Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood</line>
  <line n="502">Or Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee</line>
  <line n="503">In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest</line>
  <line n="504">Turns Atheist, as did _Ely’s_ Sons, who fill’d</line>
  <line n="505">With lust and violence the house of God.</line>
  <line n="506">In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns</line>
  <line n="507">And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse</line>
  <line n="508">Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,</line>
  <line n="509">And injury and outrage: And when Night</line>
  <line n="510">Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons</line>
  <line n="511">Of _Belial_, flown with insolence and wine.</line>
  <line n="512">Witness the Streets of _Sodom_, and that night</line>
  <line n="513">In _Gibeah_, when hospitable Dores</line>
  <line n="514">Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.</line>
  <line n="515">These were the prime in order and in might;</line>
  <line n="516">The rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,</line>
  <line n="517">Th’ _Ionian_ Gods, of _Javans_ Issue held</line>
  <line n="518">Gods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth</line>
  <line n="519">Thir boasted Parents; _Titian_ Heav’ns first born</line>
  <line n="520">With his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d</line>
  <line n="521">By younger _Saturn_, he from mightier _Jove_</line>
  <line n="522">His own and _Rhea’s_ Son like measure found;</line>
  <line n="523">So _Jove_ usurping reign’d: these first in _Creet_</line>
  <line n="524">And _Ida_ known, thence on the Snowy top</line>
  <line n="525">Of cold _Olympus_ rul’d the middle Air</line>
  <line n="526">Thir highest Heav’n; or on the _Delphian_ Cliff,</line>
  <line n="527">Or in _Dodona_, and through all the bounds</line>
  <line n="528">Of _Doric_ Land; or who with _Saturn_ old</line>
  <line n="529">Fled over _Adria_ to th’ _Hesperian_ Fields,</line>
  <line n="530">And ore the _Celtic_ roam’d the utmost Isles.</line>
  <line n="531">All these and more came flocking; but with looks</line>
  <line n="532">Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d</line>
  <line n="533">Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief</line>
  <line n="534">Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost</line>
  <line n="535">In loss it self; which on his count’nance cast</line>
  <line n="536">Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride</line>
  <line n="537">Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore</line>
  <line n="538">Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d</line>
  <line n="539">Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.</line>
  <line n="540">Then strait commands that at the warlike sound</line>
  <line n="541">Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard</line>
  <line n="542">His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d</line>
  <line n="543">_Azazel_ as his right, a Cherube tall:</line>
  <line n="544">Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld</line>
  <line n="545">Th’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t</line>
  <line n="546">Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind</line>
  <line n="547">With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,</line>
  <line n="548">Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while</line>
  <line n="549">Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:</line>
  <line n="550">At which the universal Host upsent</line>
  <line n="551">A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond</line>
  <line n="552">Frighted the Reign of _Chaos_ and old Night.</line>
  <line n="553">All in a moment through the gloom were seen</line>
  <line n="554">Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air</line>
  <line n="555">With Orient Colours waving: with them rose</line>
  <line n="556">A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms</line>
  <line n="557">Appear’d, and serried Shields in thick array</line>
  <line n="558">Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move</line>
  <line n="559">In perfect _Phalanx_ to the Dorian mood</line>
  <line n="560">Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d</line>
  <line n="561">To highth of noblest temper Hero’s old</line>
  <line n="562">Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage</line>
  <line n="563">Deliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d</line>
  <line n="564">With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,</line>
  <line n="565">Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage</line>
  <line n="566">With solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase</line>
  <line n="567">Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain</line>
  <line n="568">From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they</line>
  <line n="569">Breathing united force with fixed thought</line>
  <line n="570">Mov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d</line>
  <line n="571">Thir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now</line>
  <line n="572">Advanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front</line>
  <line n="573">Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise</line>
  <line n="574">Of Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield,</line>
  <line n="575">Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief</line>
  <line n="576">Had to impose: He through the armed Files</line>
  <line n="577">Darts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse</line>
  <line n="578">The whole Battalion views, thir order due,</line>
  <line n="579">Thir visages and stature as of Gods,</line>
  <line n="580">Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart</line>
  <line n="581">Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength</line>
  <line n="582">Glories: For never since created man,</line>
  <line n="583">Met such imbodied force, as nam’d with these</line>
  <line n="584">Could merit more then that small infantry</line>
  <line n="585">Warr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood</line>
  <line n="586">Of _Phlegra_ with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d</line>
  <line n="587">That fought at _Theb’s_ and _Ilium_, on each side</line>
  <line n="588">Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds</line>
  <line n="589">In Fable or _Romance_ of _Uthers_ Son</line>
  <line n="590">Begirt with _British_ and _Armoric_ Knights;</line>
  <line n="591">And all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel</line>
  <line n="592">Jousted in _Aspramont_ or _Montalban_,</line>
  <line n="593">_Damasco_, or _Marocco_, or _Trebisond_,</line>
  <line n="594">Or whom _Biserta_ sent from _Afric_ shore</line>
  <line n="595">When _Charlemain_ with all his Peerage fell</line>
  <line n="596">By _Fontarabbia_.  Thus far these beyond</line>
  <line n="597">Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d</line>
  <line n="598">Thir dread Commander: he above the rest</line>
  <line n="599">In shape and gesture proudly eminent</line>
  <line n="600">Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost</line>
  <line n="601">All her Original brightness, nor appear’d</line>
  <line n="602">Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess</line>
  <line n="603">Of Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n</line>
  <line n="604">Looks through the Horizontal misty Air</line>
  <line n="605">Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon</line>
  <line n="606">In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds</line>
  <line n="607">On half the Nations, and with fear of change</line>
  <line n="608">Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon</line>
  <line n="609">Above them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face</line>
  <line n="610">Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care</line>
  <line n="611">Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes</line>
  <line n="612">Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride</line>
  <line n="613">Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast</line>
  <line n="614">Signs of remorse and passion to behold</line>
  <line n="615">The fellows of his crime, the followers rather</line>
  <line n="616">(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d</line>
  <line n="617">For ever now to have their lot in pain,</line>
  <line n="618">Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t</line>
  <line n="619">Of Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung</line>
  <line n="620">For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,</line>
  <line n="621">Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire</line>
  <line n="622">Hath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,</line>
  <line n="623">With singed top their stately growth though bare</line>
  <line n="624">Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d</line>
  <line n="625">To speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend</line>
  <line n="626">From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round</line>
  <line n="627">With all his Peers: attention held them mute.</line>
  <line n="628">Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,</line>
  <line n="629">Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last</line>
  <line n="630">Words interwove with sighs found out their way.</line>
  <line n="631"></line>
  <line n="632">O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers</line>
  <line n="633">Matchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife</line>
  <line n="634">Was not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,</line>
  <line n="635">As this place testifies, and this dire change</line>
  <line n="636">Hateful to utter: but what power of mind</line>
  <line n="637">Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth</line>
  <line n="638">Of knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,</line>
  <line n="639">How such united force of Gods, how such</line>
  <line n="640">As stood like these, could ever know repulse?</line>
  <line n="641">For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,</line>
  <line n="642">That all these puissant Legions, whose exile</line>
  <line n="643">Hath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend</line>
  <line n="644">Self-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.</line>
  <line n="645">For me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,</line>
  <line n="646">If counsels different, or danger shun’d</line>
  <line n="647">By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns</line>
  <line n="648">Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure</line>
  <line n="649">Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,</line>
  <line n="650">Consent or custome, and his Regal State</line>
  <line n="651">Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,</line>
  <line n="652">Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.</line>
  <line n="653">Henceforth his might we know, and know our own</line>
  <line n="654">So as not either to provoke, or dread</line>
  <line n="655">New warr, provok’t; our better part remains</line>
  <line n="656">To work in close design, by fraud or guile</line>
  <line n="657">What force effected not: that he no less</line>
  <line n="658">At length from us may find, who overcomes</line>
  <line n="659">By force, hath overcome but half his foe.</line>
  <line n="660">Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife</line>
  <line n="661">There went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long</line>
  <line n="662">Intended to create, and therein plant</line>
  <line n="663">A generation, whom his choice regard</line>
  <line n="664">Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:</line>
  <line n="665">Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps</line>
  <line n="666">Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:</line>
  <line n="667">For this Infernal Pit shall never hold</line>
  <line n="668">Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse</line>
  <line n="669">Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts</line>
  <line n="670">Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,</line>
  <line n="671">For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr</line>
  <line n="672">Open or understood must be resolv’d.</line>
  <line n="673"></line>
  <line n="674">He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew</line>
  <line n="675">Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs</line>
  <line n="676">Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze</line>
  <line n="677">Far round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d</line>
  <line n="678">Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s</line>
  <line n="679">Clash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,</line>
  <line n="680">Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.</line>
  <line n="681"></line>
  <line n="682">There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top</line>
  <line n="683">Belch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire</line>
  <line n="684">Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign</line>
  <line n="685">That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,</line>
  <line n="686">The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed</line>
  <line n="687">A numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands</line>
  <line n="688">Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d</line>
  <line n="689">Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,</line>
  <line n="690">Or cast a Rampart.  _Mammon_ led them on,</line>
  <line n="691">_Mammon_, the least erected Spirit that fell</line>
  <line n="692">From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks &amp; thoughts</line>
  <line n="693">Were always downward bent, admiring more</line>
  <line n="694">The riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,</line>
  <line n="695">Then aught divine or holy else enjoy’d</line>
  <line n="696">In vision beatific: by him first</line>
  <line n="697">Men also, and by his suggestion taught,</line>
  <line n="698">Ransack’d the Center, and with impious hands</line>
  <line n="699">Rifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth</line>
  <line n="700">For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew</line>
  <line n="701">Op’nd into the Hill a spacious wound</line>
  <line n="702">And dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire</line>
  <line n="703">That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best</line>
  <line n="704">Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those</line>
  <line n="705">Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell</line>
  <line n="706">Of _Babel_, and the works of _Memphian_ Kings,</line>
  <line n="707">Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,</line>
  <line n="708">And Strength and Art are easily outdone</line>
  <line n="709">By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour</line>
  <line n="710">What in an age they with incessant toyle</line>
  <line n="711">And hands innumerable scarce perform</line>
  <line n="712">Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,</line>
  <line n="713">That underneath had veins of liquid fire</line>
  <line n="714">Sluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude</line>
  <line n="715">With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,</line>
  <line n="716">Severing each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:</line>
  <line n="717">A third as soon had form’d within the ground</line>
  <line n="718">A various mould, and from the boyling cells</line>
  <line n="719">By strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,</line>
  <line n="720">As in an Organ from one blast of wind</line>
  <line n="721">To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.</line>
  <line n="722">Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge</line>
  <line n="723">Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound</line>
  <line n="724">Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,</line>
  <line n="725">Built like a Temple, where _Pilasters_ round</line>
  <line n="726">Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid</line>
  <line n="727">With Golden Architrave; nor did there want</line>
  <line n="728">Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,</line>
  <line n="729">The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not _Babilon_,</line>
  <line n="730">Nor great _Alcairo_ such magnificence</line>
  <line n="731">Equal’d in all thir glories, to inshrine</line>
  <line n="732">_Belus_ or _Serapis_ thir Gods, or seat</line>
  <line n="733">Thir Kings, when _Aegypt_ with _Assyria_ strove</line>
  <line n="734">In wealth and luxurie.  Th’ ascending pile</line>
  <line n="735">Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores</line>
  <line n="736">Op’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide</line>
  <line n="737">Within, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth</line>
  <line n="738">And level pavement: from the arched roof</line>
  <line n="739">Pendant by suttle Magic many a row</line>
  <line n="740">Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed</line>
  <line n="741">With Naphtha and _Asphaltus_ yeilded light</line>
  <line n="742">As from a sky.  The hasty multitude</line>
  <line n="743">Admiring enter’d, and the work some praise</line>
  <line n="744">And some the Architect: his hand was known</line>
  <line n="745">In Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,</line>
  <line n="746">Where Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,</line>
  <line n="747">And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King</line>
  <line n="748">Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,</line>
  <line n="749">Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.</line>
  <line n="750">Nor was his name unheard or unador’d</line>
  <line n="751">In ancient Greece; and in _Ausonian_ land</line>
  <line n="752">Men call’d him _Mulciber_; and how he fell</line>
  <line n="753">From Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry _Jove_</line>
  <line n="754">Sheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn</line>
  <line n="755">To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,</line>
  <line n="756">A Summers day; and with the setting Sun</line>
  <line n="757">Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,</line>
  <line n="758">On _Lemnos_ th’ _Aegaean_ Ile: thus they relate,</line>
  <line n="759">Erring; for he with this rebellious rout</line>
  <line n="760">Fell long before; nor aught avail’d him now</line>
  <line n="761">To have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape</line>
  <line n="762">By all his Engins, but was headlong sent</line>
  <line n="763">With his industrious crew to build in hell.</line>
  <line n="764">Mean while the winged Haralds by command</line>
  <line n="765">Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony</line>
  <line n="766">And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim</line>
  <line n="767">A solemn Councel forthwith to be held</line>
  <line n="768">At _Pandaemonium_, the high Capital</line>
  <line n="769">Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d</line>
  <line n="770">From every and Band squared Regiment</line>
  <line n="771">By place or choice the worthiest; they anon</line>
  <line n="772">With hundreds and with thousands trooping came</line>
  <line n="773">Attended: all access was throng’d, the Gates</line>
  <line n="774">And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall</line>
  <line n="775">(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold</line>
  <line n="776">Wont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair</line>
  <line n="777">Defi’d the best of Panim chivalry</line>
  <line n="778">To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)</line>
  <line n="779">Thick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,</line>
  <line n="780">Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees</line>
  <line n="781">In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,</line>
  <line n="782">Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive</line>
  <line n="783">In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers</line>
  <line n="784">Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,</line>
  <line n="785">The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,</line>
  <line n="786">New rub’d with Baume, expatiate and confer</line>
  <line n="787">Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd</line>
  <line n="788">Swarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n,</line>
  <line n="789">Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd</line>
  <line n="790">In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons</line>
  <line n="791">Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room</line>
  <line n="792">Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race</line>
  <line n="793">Beyond the _Indian_ Mount, or Faerie Elves,</line>
  <line n="794">Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side</line>
  <line n="795">Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,</line>
  <line n="796">Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon</line>
  <line n="797">Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth</line>
  <line n="798">Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance</line>
  <line n="799">Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;</line>
  <line n="800">At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.</line>
  <line n="801">Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms</line>
  <line n="802">Reduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large,</line>
  <line n="803">Though without number still amidst the Hall</line>
  <line n="804">Of that infernal Court.  But far within</line>
  <line n="805">And in thir own dimensions like themselves</line>
  <line n="806">The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim</line>
  <line n="807">In close recess and secret conclave sat</line>
  <line n="808">A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,</line>
  <line n="809">Frequent and full.  After short silence then</line>
  <line n="810">And summons read, the great consult began.</line>
