        <lb n="3">Let the bird of loudest lay,
On the sole Arabian tree,
Herald sad and trumpet be,
To whose sound chaste wings obey.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="7">But thou shrieking harbinger,
Foul precurrer of the fiend,
Augur of the fever's end,
To this troop come thou not near!</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="11">From this session interdict
Every fowl of tyrant wing,
Save the eagle, feather'd king:
Keep the obsequy so strict.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="15">Let the priest in surplice white,
That defunctive music can,
Be the death-divining swan,
Lest the requiem lack his right.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="19">And thou treble-dated crow,
That thy sable gender makest
With the breath thou givest and takest,
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.</lb>

      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="23">Here the anthem doth commence:
Love and constancy is dead;
Phoenix and the turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="27">So they loved, as love in twain
Had the essence but in one;
Two distincts, division none:
Number there in love was slain.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="31">Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
Distance, and no space was seen
'Twixt the turtle and his queen:
But in them it were a wonder.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="35">So between them love did shine,
That the turtle saw his right
Flaming in the phoenix' sight;
Either was the other's mine.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="39">Property was thus appalled,
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was called.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="43">Reason, in itself confounded,
Saw division grow together,
To themselves yet either neither,
Simple were so well compounded,</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="47">That it cried, How true a twain
Seemeth this concordant one!
Love hath reason, reason none,
If what parts can so remain.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="51">Whereupon it made this threne
To the phoenix and the dove,
Co-supremes and stars of love,
As chorus to their tragic scene.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="55">THRENOS.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="56">Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclosed in cinders lie.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="59">Death is now the phoenix' nest
And the turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="62">Leaving no posterity:
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="65">Truth may seem, but cannot be:
Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be.</lb>
      </sp>
      <sp who="#Poet">
        <lb n="68">To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</lb>
